Warning: A suspended resource finished loading inside a test, but the event was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that resolves suspended data should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {
  /* finish loading suspended data */
});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://reactjs.org/link/wrap-tests-with-act

});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://reactjs.org/link/wrap-tests-with-act
