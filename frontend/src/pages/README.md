# Pages Directory

The pages folder aggregates route-level components that assemble domain logic, hooks, and shared UI elements. Each page focuses on orchestrating data flows while delegating state management to hooks and domain modules.

## Structure

- `*.tsx` files correspond to routed screens referenced by the React Router configuration.
- The `__tests__/` folder contains render tests and scenario-based coverage for page-level flows.
- FP utilities (`Result`, `Option`) should be used to model async state transitions inside pages.

## Authoring Guidelines

1. Import data through services or hooks; never instantiate fetch logic inline.
2. Keep form logic inside `useFormValidation` or domain-specific hooks.
3. Use Ant Design components for layout and interactions; apply custom styling sparingly.
4. Document exported pages with a JSDoc block summarising the flow and linking to relevant domain modules.
5. Add inline comments when coordinating complex multi-step flows (e.g., optimistic updates).
